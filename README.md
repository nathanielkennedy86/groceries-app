# Groceries

Groceries is a web-based grocery-management app built with Angular 2. The app was built to show how easy Angular 2 makes it to share code across multiple environments. This web implementation shares its services with the [NativeScript-built iOS and Android Groceries app](https://github.com/NativeScript/sample-Groceries).
